Things that still need worked out

*Plot.R
the lines are not unique
	(already ahve code for this)

*Actual runs
will need to scale up when run on Easly

*RunModel.R
question that is unresolved: when creating a generation born column, should migrants have a gen born of 0 (which is what I have for the starting pop) or should they have a the year that they migrated as the gen born?
or year they migrated minus their age?
currently, I have it still set to 0 (aka all migrants are still marked at gen born column as 0) 
depending on how I calculate reproductive success, this may matter***

*longevity = fitness?
since we have both repro success and longevity, should this also be used?

*FINAL and Pop
note that sometimes the age is 10. check how that can be and what might need to be done to fix that. 

*Things to analyze
N vs Ne? (would Ne be those that are *able* to breed, or only those that *do*?)) -- could use matchoice numbers?
	>>> IS NE THOSE THAT ARE ACTIVELY MATING OR THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BREED????
	HOW TO MEASURE AND WHAT TO KEEP TRACK? (CALL BRAD) MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY CALCULATE THIS

*MateChoice.R
#consider if migrants should be preferentially chosen to be parents - should we follow introduced alleles if this is the case?
	migrants =/= effective migrants
	*consider what to do for reproductive success for migrants before moving into pop cuz unlikely that they will be zero*
	THIS IS OK CUZ EFFECTIVE MIGRANTS ARE THE ONES THAT MATTER AND WE DONT WANT TO BREAK THE CODE -- CAN MAKE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THIS ANYWAYS!
	MAKE SURE THERE ARE CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THAT MIGRANTS ARENT THE ONLY ONES IN THE POP AND/OR BREEDING
	INSERT NOTES TOO SO THAT WE DONT FORGET THIS

*Stochastic.R
Can newly created babies die? >>> BECAUSE WE MAKE THE NUMBER THAT WE NEED
	>>> DONT FORGET TO CALL THIS BOTTLENECK WHEN TALKING WITH JANNA LOL
	>>> MOVE THIS TO AFTER DEATH - MAKE SURE NEW K IS BEING SAVED

Do I need to keep track of the sex ratio? >>> GENERATE THIS ANYWAYS BECAUSE I AM ALREADY DOING THIS

ADD NUMBER OF MALES THAT BRED ADN THE NUMBER OF FEMALES THAT BRED IN THAT YEAR (MAY BE ABLE TO BE LIKE NE/IN PLACE OF NE)
NUMBER OF MATES? (USE THE FUNCTION "TABLE") data$habitat.mate (or could try "apply")
