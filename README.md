Model description last updated: 10/23/2023

**Model Objective**
Establish a model that can simulate genetic diversity across hundreds of years to evaluate the risks and benefits of increasing migration into high extinction risk populations

**Model Questions**
1. How do genetic characteristics of the migrant source population, specifically the population-specific unique genetic variants that determine individual fitness, influence recipient population stability and evolution?

2. How does recipient population size (e.g., carrying capacity) and trend (e.g., increasing, decreasing) alter the magnitude of the populationâ€™s evolutionary response to immigration?

*These aims will support future considerations of promoting migration (via corridors or translocations) when managing species on the brink of extinction. Please see the final publication for more information about the code and scripts.*


**Note**: Use of the provided code requires a specific configuration of folders. Within the directory holding all of the provided scripts, there should be two folders: Source and Output. All .R files that execute the simulation, except for Cover.R, are found in source into the 'Source' directory. After defining parameter values within Cover.R and running the code, all output files (plots and tables) will be directed into the 'Output' directory.
