### Eco-evolutionary models of population decline: how does migration effect long-term population persistence when extirpation risk is high?
**Gina Lamka and Dr. Janna Willoughby**


**Question 1:** *Does population size and stability change with varying population growth rates, when mortality rate is constant?*

These results suggest that the growth rate does have an effect on the population size and stability, with the population size at equilibrium greater as the population growth rate increases. 

**Question 2:** *Does population size and stability change with varying migration rates?*

In the absence of migration, a population with K = 1000 would crash after approximately 40 years. When gene flow occurs - in the form of migration from a source population - the population can persist for at least 100 generations. Higher migration rates result in higher total population sizes. 

**Question 3:** *Does population-wide heterozygosity change with varying carrying capacity?*

There does not seem to be a significant difference in observed heterozygosity with varying carrying capacity, though statistical tests would be required to confirm these results. 

**Question 4:** *Does population-wide observed heterozygosity change with varying population growth rates?*

The greatest difference in observed heterozygosity is between simulations with the highest and lowest growth rates. Somewhat surprisingly, populations with a high growth rate have decreased heterozygosity compared to those with a low growth rate. 

**Question 5:** *Does population-wide heterozygosity change with varying migration rates?*

Statistical tests will need to be conducted to determine if a migration rate of 1-5 individuals is significantly different than a migration rate of 5-10 individuals per generation. In the absence of migration, the population crashes after approximately 40 generations, and the observed heterozygosity is highly variable. 


### ***Final results suggest that migration rate, carrying capacity, and population growth rate contribute to population persistence and population-wide genetic diversity.***
