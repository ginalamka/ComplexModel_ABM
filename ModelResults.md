### Eco-evolutionary models of population decline: how does migration effect long-term population persistence when extirpation risk is high?
**Gina Lamka and Dr. Janna Willoughby**

*Does population wide observed heterozygosity change with varying population growth rates?*

**Model Objectives**
1. Examine how the migration rate alters the long-term population outcome when migration is initiated at various population sizes and trajectories.
2. Determine the conditions at which consistent migration prevents population crashes, despite reductions in carrying capacity.
3. *Next Step: Assess if migration patterns better predict population crashes relative to other measures used to rank conservation concern (e.g., number of adults, IUCN).*

*These aims will support future considerations of promoting migration (via corridors or translocations) when managing species on the brink of extinction.*
