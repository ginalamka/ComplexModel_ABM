New thoughts and issues as of 2022

- STILL having issues with the population CRASHING for the first several years until maxage
  locations where maxage is used: initializing pop and source, death
  this means it might be because the init ages are screwey, or because I am killing them weird. (maybe not generating enough babies?)
  **NEED to figure this out

- what should the generation born column say for migrants? 
  options:  0 to mark as source pop
            year they migrated
            year they migrated minus age

- should mutation occur throughout the genome? this should occur when generating babies, correct? 
  I think what I will do is create a Mutation.R function, but place it in Breed.R rather than RunModel.R
  make sure to have an on/off switch for this also
  
- note that currenly migration happens EVERY year since nmig is between 1-5

- note that migrants are not preferentially marked for breeding, so migrants =/= effective migrants

- still need to add in the migrant tracked SNPs

- 1/13/22 -- create generation born/generation died/and generation entered so that migrants are analyzed correctly
  gen born and died will be used for longevity calculations
  gen entered and gen died will be used for reproductive success calculations
  *consider what to do for reproductive success for migrants before moving into pop cuz unlikely that they will be zero*
  
- 2/8/22 -- consider Ne - perhaps the crash is cuz NE is too small?
  remember that bottlenecks have greater effect on allelic diverstiy than heterozygosity
  difference is driven by skewed sex ratio (keep track of sex ratio?)
  look at chapter 7 of allendorf's book for inspiration

                  Replicate >                    #Add reps
                    Analyze >                    #analyze the outcome
                      Validate                   #compare to real data


Notes that may be helpful in the future:

- validate the model [look at pattern oriented modeling slides from class] 
  by double checking if alleles are added and lost to the population at the same rate as expected (1/2N)
  this will be done with heterozygosity values of the population following migration
  different allele frequencies of migrants will induce the changes here as a pattern
  compare this rate to the equation of loss of genetic diversity 1/2Ne to examine trends
  this works because I am giving indv allele frequ, but not for the whole population
  
- theory testing: vary the sizes of source and focal pops to examine density-dependent effects
  I could also add in habitat complexity to determine how that affects migration

- in krats, breeding is polygynandrous, which means multiple females breed with multiple males
  https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/94/6/1258/903126
  
- currently, migration is by # of indv, but in future, should be 0-10% of population
  consider *why* indv may move - boldness, resources, looking for less density
  consider male vs female migrants

- can do a fitness-dependent behavior, but not multiple. 
  this can be either mate choice, fitness-dependent death, or migration behavior, consider implications of each

- offspring should inherit alleles from mom/dad, not be assigned randomly
  assign microsat and SNP loci, not just A/a alleles
  
- consider sex ratio - should this vary year to year or be ~1:1

- notes on operators in R https://www.tutorialgateway.org/logical-operators-in-r/

- notes on BREAK / NEXT - for example, check if there are more pairs to iterate over, if no, Break
  https://statisticsglobe.com/r-break-next-function-for-loop-example
  
- if matrix is wierd, one way to check dimensions is to do dim(pop), dim(source), etc.

#other things to consider later --- shrinking K over time to simulate habitat destruction
#add in mutation??
#make sure that migrants are prefered for matechoice - do this by first adding pairs with migrants, then adding in the random other pairs
    #this will make it so that I am tracking effective migrants rather than actual migrants. 
    
    
Notes from weekly meeting 11/1/2021
#how to analyze these data
  He, Ho, mean lifetime reproductive success (fitness), number of migrants?, population size over time
  Note: while keeping the starting source and focal pop, I can calc the difference in hetero, etc before and after the simulation!
  #make sure to include paramtere values: rr (replicate), year, k, [anything that will be variable across runs], THEN the output data
  
NOTE: when finished with the code, use this R Style Guide to clean it up
  https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109l/unrestricted/resources/google-style.html
  
#before adding in a bunch of parameter combos, do one and look at file size because YOU COULD KILL ALL STORAGE ON COMPUTER
#therefore dont make it too crazy at once, just get something to work for class. 

##QUESTIONS 11/11/2021
I am tracking alleles specifically from migrants following reproduction. if an ancestor is a migrant, the alleles will be 1, 
if they are not migrants, the allele is 0. when creating babies, I would like to do some sort of conditional so that 
if a parent or ancestor is a migrant (a negative ID number), then the allele should be a 1, if not, 0. 
tried if, ifelse, apply

instead of the above idea, add 1000 additional migratory SNPs so that migrants all =1 and nonmig=0 and then go through mendelian genetics from then on. 

#from SourcePop.R
  #consider if new alleles should be given here, and what the implications would be
  #consider altering the allele frequencies at the source and focal populations 
  #consider altering the population size of source population, think about why indv disperse 
    #i.e. if they are looking for resources vs more mates vs want less competition
  #think about age and sex biases
  
Different distributions 
  poisson - dpois
  uniform - dunif
  gamma - dgamma
  log-normal - dlnorm
  exponential - dexp
  normal - dnorm
  
##Remember that whatever you return at the end of the function is what you set the function equal to in RunModel
#str(object) tells type of object
#check type of object using typeof(numboff), want it to be an integer, not double

#for the column alive v dead, make sure that the functions taht need pop get a temp pop for only adults (mate choice, breeding) but hten make sure to add the indv (breed) to the main pop, not temp pop
