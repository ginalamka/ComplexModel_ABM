Notes that may be helpful in the future:

- in krats, breeding is polygynandrous, which means multiple females breed with multiple males
  https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/94/6/1258/903126
  
- currently, migration is by # of indv, but in future, should be 0-10% of population
  consider *why* indv may move - boldness, resources, looking for less density
  consider male vs female migrants

- can do a fitness-dependent behavior, but not multiple. 
  this can be either mate choice, fitness-dependent death, or migration behavior, consider implications of each

- offspring should inherit alleles from mom/dad, not be assigned randomly
  assign microsat and SNP loci, not just A/a alleles
  
- consider sex ratio - should this vary year to year or be ~1:1
